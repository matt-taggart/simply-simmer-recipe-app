# Simply Simmer

A full stack AI application that allows users to extract ingredients and cooking instructions from recipes sites. No more annoying ads and scrolling endlessly to find recipes. Includes recipe search, ability to save recipes, and leverages LLMs to modify recipes based on preferences/dietary restrictions. Started off as a private personal project, but decided to release as a simple example of fullstack application that others can fork and work off of. Demonstrates an example of leveraging Shadn, Tailwind, LLMs, Supabase, Brave Search API, and Stripe payment together in an application.
